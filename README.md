# animatedEarthQuake

This Project Covers basic consepts of android like Recyclerview button click, dynamic fragments and
some tricky parts like getting data from recycler view to dynamic fragments, handle the data when screen rotates etc..

When you click on the earth quake list the screen vibrates with respect to magnitude of earthquake.

More over i am not able to implement arcgis and mapbox and heat map but i will add these features as soon as possible
